# BitScoop Ops Buddy Demo

This application demonstrates the power and versatility of the [BitScoop](https://bitscoop.com) platform.
Ops Buddy has two components: a web app and an Alexa Skill.
The app allows users to create an account using a Google account for signup.
In their Ops Buddy account, they can configure various services about which they want to retrieve information.
The Alexa Skill, after being linked with the same Google account used to sign up for Ops Buddy, can be queried to retrieve up-to-date information about the services configured in the Ops Buddy account.

The [tutorials](./tutorials) folder contains instructions on configuring the skill on our publicly-hosted copy and/or setting up and configuring a copy of your own.
