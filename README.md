# BitScoop Ops Buddy Demo

This demo will show you how to set up your own copy of the BitScoop Ops Buddy demo.
The app that is set up allows users to create an account through a web app using a Google account for signup.
In their Ops Buddy account, they can configure various services about which they want to retrieve information.
The demo also sets up an Alexa skill.
This skill, after being linked with the same Google account used to sign up for Ops Buddy, can be queried to retrieve up-to-date information about the services configured in the Ops Buddy account.

We provide a public copy of this demo at opsbuddy.bitscoop.com, as well as a publicly-available Alexa skill called 'BitScoop Ops Buddy', if you want to see the demo in action without having to set up a copy of your own.
Follow the final sections of steps 4 and 5 of the tutorial to create an Ops Buddy account, configure it, and then install and link the Alexa Skill.
